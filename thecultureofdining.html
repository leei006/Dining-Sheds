           By the time the city fathers get around to settling the rights of the sidewalk cafés the outdoor dining season will be virtually over. After the middle of September the climate at this point in the world’s surface grown unsteady. Some time next week expect that bit of mystic folklore, “ the line-storm.” Dining out of doors will require mackintosh and sea boots during the expected equinoctial downpour. Nor should we be ungrateful for the pleasures we have had unmarred by the complaints of craven souls who splutter about sidewalk encumbrances. There have been nearly three months of supping behind the privet hedges on tiny painted tables amid the roar and fumes of our monstrous traffic.
Louis will tell you, between rushes of the genteel growler, that instead of being laid off every other fortnight, he now works everyday, and that the blossoming of the pavement beer garden has made work for fifty men in his hotel. Whatever the regulations may be, everyone is happy. No one is crowded except the diners and quaffers. Even the bus-riders and passers-by enjoy ogling the trenchermen through the sprigs of hedge. Compassionate government, such as  we are accustomed to in New York, will find some way to tolerate an amiable and picturesque vagary of public taste.
No one will pretend that New York is the ideal city for outdoor dining. It is gritty even in the Village gardens where meals have been served outdoors in the Summer for years. It is grittier on the sidewalks. On lower Fifth Avenue the gunfire and racket of motos, trucks and surface cars shatter the elegance of post-prandial chatter. Nor is the service brilliant. The kitchens and taprooms are so far from the sidewalk that a seven course is subject to frequent delays. At best, dining on the sidewalk under these conditions isa  pleasure that must be tolerably seasons with fancy.
In matters of that sort New Yorkers have abundant fancy. When it comes to minor enchantments our imagination is vivid. No eye is too dull to find in the dreary brown surface of the city some crevice where the graces and amenities can be practiced. We long for neighborliness. We covet informality. We conjure small-town felicities out of corners of the city that the realist would describe as fetid and shabby. Give us a crooked street and we can find romance lurking there. Give us a tottering old chimney and we can hang a poem on it.
The romance of the sidewalk cafés partakes of that sentiment. They are the gayest spots in the streets they inhabit. The awning are carnival roofs. The privet growing in the brightly painted boxes looks refreshing. Even though you cannot hear the fiddler above the traffic rumble, you relish the tradition of the town minstrel. It is the idea that counts, and the idea of the sidewalk café in New York is genius. From the speakeasy to the pavement beef garden is like taking orders in virtue. May the city fathers in their benevolence and wisdom bless our faltering progress upward and teach us to keep our eating holy.
